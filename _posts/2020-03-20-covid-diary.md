## Friday 20 March
I woke up to learn California is on stay-at-home orders. That made a pile of work for me because my remote team works there. Next was a call from my physical therapist asking if I was interested in virtual PT. Ok, that's a little weird but better than nothing.

I only left the house to go running. Neighors are unusually friendly, the isolation is getting to people. The news from Italy is terrifying and while the isolation is hard, the alternative looks a lot worse. I've been working a lot, doing my normal job during the day and coronavirus data science in the off hours. If I'm sitting at home I may as well be useful.
