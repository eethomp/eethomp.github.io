title:  "Covid Diary Week 1"
---

One of my friends pointed out that we are in a historic time. The country and possibly the world will never be the same. I'm starting a journal of events that have happened to me during this pandemic.

13 March 2020 Friday
The run on grocery stores is intense. I went to Safeway after a physical therapy appointment. There was no parking. That never happens. All hand sanitizers were sold out, pasta was low, canned goods were low, paper goods almost gone. Lines were to the back of the store. It took me 20 minutes in the enormous self checkout line to buy some produce. People were joking trying to avoid freaking out. School closings starting Monday the 16th were announced.

##14 March 2020 Saturday
I played an Irish gig at Lahinch Pub in Potomac, MD. It was the Saturday before St. Patrick's Day and there were only a handful of people in the pub. The manager asked us to shorten our gig because they were losing money. Unheard of. Church closings were announced. CDC has recommended no gatherings of over 50 people for the next eight weeks and Maryland is complying. My trip to Ocean City to a handbell convention March 20 canceled. Scott and I start coding CovidNearMe(https://covidnearme.org).

##15 March 2020 Sunday
More closings announced. My handbell choir rehearsals were canceled for two weeks. Washington DC is starting to shut down. My boss is a healthcare professional and is quarantined at home for the week because he traveled abroad. Ryan Kappedal is starting a coronovirus data science effort to inform policy makers. I've joined it.

##16 March 2020 Monday
Restaurants in Maryland must be carry out or delivery only. Bars are largely closed. My St. Patrick's Day gig is canceled. Things are starting to feel a little weird. People give each other space on the sidewalks. The stock market has cratered in a historic crash. I'm trying not to stress about money.

##17 March 2020 Tuesday
All Maryland gyms, movie theaters closed. People are getting laid off. Worst St. Patrick's Day ever. I spent the day at home, working. Went out for a run, at least I can get outside and have some exercise.

##18 March 2020 Wednesday
I received a care package from Mom of antibacterial wipes, masks, and gloves and was delighted. Bizarre. Many stores are going online only. Amazon is focusing on essential deliveries only.

##19 March 2020 Thursday
Maryland cases have doubled since Sunday. All enclosed shopping malls and entertainment venues are closed. Casinos are closed. On the bright side, bars, restaurants, and distilleries can deliver alcohol. Win? I went to physical therapy and my PT warned me that the office might close. I have sciatica and not getting treatment would be a drag. Another doctor contacted me to see if next week's appointment could be done over telemedicine.

The grocery store was not crowded, thankfully. Shelf-stable items were sparsely stocked but there was plenty of produce. I got big bags in the hopes of getting a couple weeks' worth. I went in a mask and gloves and was not the only person in glvoes. A man in the entryway was spraying down the cart handles with some sort of sanitizing solution. I am starting to get very concerned about the economy. We may end up in a depression.

Isolation is starting to get on my nerves. I'm usually pretty active, with work, music, and visits to friends. Typically I relish time alone but it's different when it's enforced.
