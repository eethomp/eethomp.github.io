title:  "COVID-19 in Ohio Prisons"
---
An article made a splash recently when it was announced that [96% of Ohio prisoners who tested positive for COVID-19 had no symptoms](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-prisons-testing-in/in-four-u-s-state-prisons-nearly-3300-inmates-test-positive-for-coronavirus-96-without-symptoms-idUSKCN2270RX). Wild speculation abounded. Are there millions of asymptomatic Americans and COVID-19 is a fizzle? Is the death rate a fraction of the 2-3% we feared? Frankly, I'm skeptical because of some other data I have access to.

The article was disappointing in that it was long on assumptions and short on data. About 3,700 poor souls in Ohio state prisons have tested positive for COVID-19 so far. The majority of two prison populations tested positive. This is important, as it shows most everyone is susceptible to COVID-19, and that the level of contagion in close quarters is extreme. The results surprised the prison system becasue most inmates did not seem sick. However, the critical missing detail is when they were tested and whether symptoms are developing. Some info on the prison website said mass testing was initiatied April 11 but it's unlikely 100% were tested on a single day. COVID-19 symptoms typically appear anywhere from 3-14 days after exposure but can take as long as 21.

The Ohio prison system is [reporting some numbers](https://www.drc.ohio.gov/) on the COVID-19 status in the prison system so I'm going to track the two facilities that had a high number of positive tests here.
