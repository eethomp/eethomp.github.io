title:  "COVID-19 Testing"
---

There's a lot of confusion about COVID-19 testing, what it is, who it's for, and what it means. One of my smartest friends made an appointment for a COVID-19 test and we realized he had no idea which test he was getting or what it meant. Testing is being held up as a magic bullet against COVID-19 but we're very far from realizing the potential value of testing. I thought I'd write something hopefully simple and easy to understand about the types and challenges of COVID-19 testing.

### Nasal or throat swabs
Nasal swabs look for the coronavirus in your nose or throat. Sometimes a doctor might test stuff you cough up, called a sputum test. This test is designed to answer one simple question: **"Is there virus in my nose or throat today?"** You could be free of coronavirus today, but become infected and test postive later. It is important to understand that the swab tests only work while you are actively infected with COVID-19. The time frame where it works is a week more or less, starting shortly before you first have symptoms.

Swab testing looks for genetic material from the virus by massively amplifying with a reaction called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). You might hear the nasal swab test called a PCR test. PCR is nice when it works. It is very specific, meaning it won't confuse the coronavirus with something else. When a PCR test is positive, it's almost always correct.

Swab tests can have false negatives though. Getting enough virus onto the swab, recovering it from the swab, and running the test takes practice and experience. The FDA approved tests used in hospitals on acutely sick people work very well; however, community testing can suffer from bad timing and poor test quality. People who get tested a week or more after they first get sick don't have much virus in their nose. That means the test can have as high as a 33% chance giving a falsely negative result (1). Also some tests are just plain bad. It's coming out that the tests China used failed 30%-40% of the time (2). The FDA is allowing unapproved tests to be sold and some of them may be equally bad. We don't really know. So if you're sick with COVID-19 symptoms, it's best to self quarantine even if you got a negative test.

The most important thing to remember about the swab tests is that it only tells you about COVID-19 *the day of the test*. It doesn't tell you anything about what happens if you run across someone who is infected tomorrow. Because of this, there is usually no reason to get a nasal or throat swab if you are not feeling sick.

### Blood testing (serology)
Blood testing or serology testing looks for antibodies your body produces after fighting off a COVID-19 infection. Once you have enough antibodies to a particular virus you are said to be immune. Sounds amazing, right? Get a blood test and prove you are immune to COVID-19 and safe. Unfortunately, we are a long way from having that work.

Developing blood tests is harder than PCR tests. The blood tests are prone to both false positives and false negatives. Each individual's antibodies are as unique as snowflakes, and we all have a broad mixture of antibodies in our blood. That makes it hard to develop a test that works for everyone. To add to the confusion, there are four other coronaviruses in the US that mostly cause colds. If you were exposed to a coronavirus cold, the antibodies that fought the cold virus can mimic COVID-19 antibodies in the test and cause a false positive result.

Right now, the best tests give a wrong answer about 1 in 20 times. That doesn't sound too bad, until you realize that probably fewer than 1 in 20 Americans has gotten COVID-19. So you get a test and it's positive for antibodies. What does it mean? Are you one of the lucky people who got COVID-19 and didn't get sick enough to realize it, or was it just a false positive? If you never had symptoms, the false positive is more likely.

Notice I said the *best* tests give 1 in 20. There are plenty of worse ones. As with the nasal swabs, FDA is allowing unapproved tests to be sold. With unapproved tests, the company has **no proof** that the test even works. Even if it is claimed to work, nobody is going to tell you, the consumer, what the accuracy is.

At this point, the main reason to consent to a serology test is to participate in a study. You can help develop better tests, especially if you had verified COVID-19 because you should have atibodies for a time. Large studies with 10,000 people or so can also help us learn about both how the tests perform in a big population and overall infection rates. If you get a test in a study and allow the scientists to keep in touch with you, they can see if a positive result means you are immune, or whether you maintain your antibodies over time. That would be truly valuable and is a good reason to volunteer.

### Immunity
The *BIGGEST* problem with the serology tests is that we know almost nothing about COVID-19 immunity. We have no clue about what a positive atibody test means if you're exposed to the virus again. Does a high result indicate immunity? What about a low result? How much antibody do you need? If you have a positive test today, will it still be positive in a month? Six months? A year? None of these questions have been answered.

If you're following COVID-19 news, you probably saw the [WHO statement that there is no evidence of COVID-19 immunity](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19). This is what they are talking about. Even if a test works, we just don't konw what a positive result means. If we're lucky, COVID-19 will be like SARS and MERS and there will be some immunity for a year or two. However, the jury is out becuase COVID-19 has only been here for three months. We can't have answers about year-long immunity until next spring unless someone has a TARDIS. If so, would you kindly let us know how this all turns out? A lot of people would like to know.

If you want more detail you should listen to [Dr. Osterholm's podcast](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/podcasts-webinars/episode-6). He's brilliant and I highly recommend it.
