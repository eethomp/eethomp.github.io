## On masks
I don't understand people who refuse to even try to protect themselves. There's evidence that [incoming filtration is better than outgoing][1]. When you think about it this makes perfect sense. Inhaling creates negative pressure and sucks the mask against your face.

All you need to do is buy a little melt blown fabric and add a filter layer to a cloth mask and even a pleated mask [can filter a pretty reasonable fraction of particles][2]. [Filti][3] is a great source and their fabric is easy to work with and decently breathable. You can also get [5 yards of BFE95 fabric from Sailrite][6]. To choose materials, check out [Mask FAQ][7] where a couple of women in Michigan have been getting mask making materials tested to NIOSH standards.

I've been making semi-disposable [2-layer Olson masks][4] by skipping the pocket and using a layer of cotton and a layer of Filti. Unfortunately washing Filti disrupts the electrostatics so once the mask gets too sweaty it has to be tossed. The alternative is to make a filter pocket mask and put Filti in the pocket but I like the breathability of a 2-layer mask. I'm experimenting with the [Protohaven Olson mask][5] now because it only has 2 layers over the mouth and nose and I'm going to see if an outer layer of quitting cotton and a pocket of thin cotton gives me good breathability and a washable mask where I can just chuck the filter and save the mask.
