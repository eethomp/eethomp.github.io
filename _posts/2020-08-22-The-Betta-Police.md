# The Betta Police and When to Ignore Them or "How Big is that Tank?"

## Part I

I've been involved in online aquarium communities since before the WWW was a thing. For some reason technically minded people are attracted to aquariums. Possibly it's because as well as being beautiful, they are a bit more challenging than dogs or cats and provide endless fodder for research and optimization. There are so many fish, plants, and inverts it is virtually impossible for one person to keep all of them in a lifetime. Online communities have been a major catalyst for the development of the hobby and information sharing.

Unfortunately, the throwaway nature of online interactions in the modern Internet has infested the aquarium community. Someone posts a beautiful betta and happens to show the whole tank and the race to the bottom is on. "How big is that tank?" asks the first Betta Police jackass. When the poster replies with anything less than 5g the immediate self-congratulatory reply follows. "I knew it. Bettas need 5g. Your tank is too small." The thread than spirals into the murky depths, with downvotes, criticism, and often flaming of the poor person who just wanted to share a particularly nice fish. If someone who actually knows how to keep bettas comes to their defense, the Betta Police flame and troll the defender as well. When the Betta Police are asked why a betta needs 5g, they offer nebulous nebular reasons or links pointing to other Betta Police articles, none of which actually make any sense to people who know how to keep bettas.

Now, let's be perfectly clear, a lot of the so-called "betta tanks" at your local Petco or PetSmart are betta death traps. Big chains have been selling quart-sized containers for bettas for decades. Unsuspecting beginners see the dispaly cup and figure a betta can live in a quart perfectly fine, and then wonder why the fish sickens and dies. What they don't realize is that in good fish stores the water in the cups is changed 100% every day or two, water conditioners control ammonia, fish are fed sparingly, and the whole fish room is warm so bettas are comfortable. Take the betta home, put it in a quart, overfeed, and neglect the water changes and it will die pretty fast. However, a 5g aquarium is no defense against ignorance and a betta will meet the same fate in an uncycled 5g, just more slowly.

However, as long as the betta's simple needs for clean, warm water are met, there is no compelling reason to house a betta in a 5g tank. Most fish the size of a betta would be cramped or have oxygen issues in a couple gallons but the Betta Police ignore the nature of the fish. Bettas are unique in that they can get the majority of their oxygen from the air, so the normal need for high surface area for oxygen exchange does not apply to bettas. They are also fiercely territorial, so they naturally spend most of their time in a small space defending their bubblenests. Even when provided with a large aquarium, they don't defend a territory much larger than a bowl.

Meeting a betta's needs are straightforward.
* Clean water
* Little to no current
* Temperature 78-80F
* Places to hide
* Jump prevention

## Bowls
The only one of these that is difficult to achieve in a bowl is temperature control, unless you happen to live in a tropical climate. If you do, you can keep bettas the way people have for 200 years, in a half-full 3 gallon bowl. Add some porous gravel at the bottom, a leafy plant for hiding, a generous handful of duckweed or water sprite, and set the bowl in a bright place so the plants can do their magic. Only fill the bowl about 60% so the floating plants can spread and the betta can't jump out. (It is a myth that only unhappy bettas jump. ALL bettas jump.) After a month or so of fairly frequent water changes, nitrifying bacteria will colonize the substrate and plants and large weekly water changes will suffice to keep the fish happy and healthy. The plants are a critical and often-neglected part of the equation. They both absorb nitrogenous fish waste and oxygenate the still water, not so much for the betta but for the nitrifying bacteria. A savvy aquarist will add a drop or two of an iron/K fertilizer like Leaf Zone a couple times a week to ensure the plants' health, and thus the health of the fish. If your betta is happy and healthy in a large bowl, in a consistently warm spot with some actively growing live plants, you may safely ignore the Betta Police.
