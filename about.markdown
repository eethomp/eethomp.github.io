This is primarily a brain dump for my software dev discoveries. My friend [fuzzygroup](https://fuzzyblog.io) has pointed out that almost everyone in devops relies heavily on the collective wisdom of the Internet. I'm always searching for solutions, and while some work well a lot don't. This blog will be my collection of solutions that worked. Perhaps you will find some of them useful.

Warranty: none whatsoever. Modern computers are wierd and whacky things. Please remember that what works in my environment may break yours.

I may intermingle things from other interests. They might even get usefully tagged if I get around to it. I do a lot of non-computer activities to preserve my sanity and get away from the eerie blue glow of the computer monitor. Fiber arts, cooking, music, running, fountain pens, and other random analog activities may appear from time to time.
